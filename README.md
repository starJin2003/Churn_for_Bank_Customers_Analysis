# Churn_for_Bank_Customers_Analysis

## Background
As advancements in technology continue to reshape various industries, it comes as no surprise that the banking sector has also been significantly influenced. The rapid growth of financial technology, better known as fintech, is captivating a substantial portion of bank customers. Interestingly, a study has revealed that a remarkable 74% of Americans are willing to leave their traditional banks in favor of safer and more cost-effective digital fintech solutions (Francis et al., 2012). Delving deeper into this statistic, it turns out that 39% of these Americans are drawn to the prospect of low-rate credit cards, while around 20% are keen on utilizing budgeting apps. It's important to note that a customer's decision to leave a bank can be influenced by various factors, such as their gender, age, salary, or even the number of products they have purchased through the bank.

## Objective
In this report, we acknowledge the well-known fact that acquiring new clients is often more complex and stressful than retaining existing ones. Understanding the factors that influence a client's decision to leave a bank can be immensely valuable. By pinpointing the reasons behind customer attrition, banks can develop targeted strategies, such as loyalty programs or retention marketing techniques, to encourage clients to remain with the institution. Gaining insight into these driving forces not only fosters customer loyalty but also enables banks to adapt and evolve in a rapidly changing financial landscape.
In this report, we chose to utilize the "Exited" column as the label for our predictive model, which indicates whether a customer has remained with the bank or not. The remaining variables were employed as features to inform our analysis. During the initial stages, we visualized the data to discern which factors held greater importance and which were less relevant. Subsequently, we trained our dataset using various classifiers and, based on performance, selected the most suitable model.
